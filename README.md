Program Aim:  

The aim of this program is to demonstrate the basic structure of a C++ program and print the message "Hello world!" along with "my first program" to the console.

Program Theory:  

#include<iostream>: This line includes the necessary header file <iostream> to enable input and output operations in the program.

using namespace std;: This line allows us to use the standard C++ library (std) without explicitly specifying it in the code. It simplifies the code by eliminating the need to prefix elements from the standard library with "std::".

int main(): This is the entry point of the program. All C++ programs start execution from the main function.

cout <<"hello world!" <<endl;: This line uses the cout (console output) stream to display the text "hello world!" to the console. <<endl is used to insert a newline character, so the next output will appear on a new line.

cout<<"my first program";: This line prints "my first program" to the console without adding a newline character, so it appears on the same line as the previous text.

return 0;: This statement indicates the successful termination of the program. The 0 return value signifies that the program executed without any errors.

Program Conclusion:

The program demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program. When executed, it prints the following output to the console:
