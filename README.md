Program: A program is like a set of instructions that you give to a computer to tell it what to do. It's like a recipe you follow to make your favorite dish.

Variables: Think of variables as containers that hold information. Just like you use a box to store your toys, you use variables to store data in a program. For example, you might have a variable called "age" to store your age.
